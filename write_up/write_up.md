> In this write-up we will be covering some common techniques malware authors often utilize in order to identify if their executable is being analyzed. Malware authors will often use these checks to make their malware act benign or simply do nothing/ self delete.


### Process Names

> We will start off this section with probably the easiest method a malware developer can use to thwart a reverse engineers efforts, looking for the process names of analysis tools. Typically malware authors won't be lazy like myself and just simply look for strings of tool file names i.e: Autoruns64.exe or Procmon64.exe... In this case you are lucky, as this is simply an example you can simply look at the dissassembled code to find the subroutine that conducts this check.
