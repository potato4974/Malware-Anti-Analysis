> In this write-up we will be covering some common techniques malware authors often utilize in order to identify if their executable is being analyzed. Malware authors will often use these checks to make their malware act benign or simply do nothing/ self delete.


### Process Names

> We will start off this section with probably the easiest method a malware developer can use to thwart a reverse engineers efforts, looking for the process names of analysis tools. Typically malware authors won't be lazy like myself and just simply look for strings of tool file names i.e: Autoruns64.exe or Procmon64.exe... In this case you are lucky, as this is simply an example you can simply look at the dissassembled code to find the subroutine that conducts this check.

>To set the scene, you are a malware analyst that has just been passed a sample piece of malware that is said to open a powershell console on a users computer.

>With an instance of procmon open, attempt to run the anti_analysis_1.exe and notice that the it should result in the creation of a notepad process. But wait... you were told that this executable was supposed to open up a powershell console on your machine. There must be some anti-analysis going on.

>After some static analysis, wether with basic tools or a dissassembler you should notice immediately that the binary is packed using upx Version 4.24.

>Once the binary has been unpacked, you should dissassemble the executable using whichever tool you are most confortable with.(IDA/Ghidra). And at this point simply search for strings related to analysis tool executable names.

As per above you can easily find the subroutine doing this name check, (Renamed here to Process_Name_Checker).

>The easiest method to resolve this type of anti_analysis is to simply rename your analysis tools so they don't match any of those checked.
